Welcome! This is the first in what I hope will become a regular stream of posts and updates on my progression through the word of data science and machine learning.

I plan to use this blog in many of the ways recommended [here](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/): as a record of progress, a collection of notes-to-self, and to hone the craft of writing for others. Starting out, my goal is to commit at least one piece of content each week. Stay tuned!
